# Prodigy-InfoTech_Intership_DS_Task_1
Here's a breakdown of what the code does:

The code imports the necessary libraries: pandas for data manipulation and matplotlib.pyplot for data visualization.

The code loads an Excel file named "Land_use_per_gram_of_protein.xlsx" into a DataFrame using pd.read_excel(). The DataFrame will hold the data for the chart.

The code extracts the necessary data from the DataFrame for the bar chart. It assigns the values from the 'Food_Type' column to the variable x and the values from the 'Land_Use_in_sqm' column to the variable y.

The code creates a new figure with a size of 10x6 inches using plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6)).

The code generates a bar chart using plt.bar(x, y). It uses the x values as the labels for the x-axis and the y values as the heights of the bars.

The code customizes the chart by setting labels for the x-axis, y-axis, and title using plt.xlabel(), plt.ylabel(), and plt.title() respectively. The x-axis is labeled as 'FoodType', the y-axis as 'LandUse sqm', and the chart is titled 'Bar Chart'.

The code displays the chart using plt.show(), which will open a separate window or display the chart directly in a Jupyter Notebook or similar environment.
